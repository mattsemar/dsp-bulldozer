## Bulldozer

Flatten an entire planet. Levels and adds foundation to each spot. Uses the current settings for burying veins and foundation color.
Takes about a minute to complete (depends on how much of planet is already flattened).

Checkbox next to the action button controls whether lines will be painted at the equator and at the meridians.

Note: some veins may not be raised (or lowered) on subsequent invocations.
