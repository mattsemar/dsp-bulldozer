Get your planet ready for a shiny new factory. Cover it in foundation in seconds or remove all existing factory buildings.

Coming soon, support for non-cheaty mode where foundation & soil pile from player's inventory are used (see 'Cheatiness' config properties).

Checkbox next to the action button controls whether guide lines will be added. Config controls types painted (equator, meridian, tropic)
Raising/lowering veins is now a separate operation that takes around a minute to complete. It can be enabled using the checkbox under the guide lines control

Use DeleteFactoryTrash config property to automatically delete items that would be littered

Non-cheaty options are not quite complete. For now, foundation is deducted properly but soil pile limits are not honored. For this mode,
foundation will be taken first from the user's inventory and then from storage containers and logistics stations on the current planet.

Check the "Environment Modification" menu to find the action button
